Frontend Assignment - Josh Technology Group

Assignment Overview

Your task is to create a Portfolio web application using HTML, CSS, and JS based on a provided mock-up design. The application should be compatible with Firefox, Chrome, and Safari browsers (use Windows version if available).

The design reference is provided via a [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/design/DIdUsbfZCRYOTuLbhezaiC/Portfolio---Set-1?node-id=1152-6650&t=JETDSsheV8K9fUxi-0) included in the document.

Requirements

- Design Consistency:

  Ensure the implementation is as pixel-perfect as possible compared to the Figma design.

- Coding Best Practices:

  Follow the best coding and optimization practices. Avoid using table tags for any layout creation.

- Browser Compatibility:

  Ensure the application functions correctly on Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.

Home Page

It should look the same as the one shown in the Figma. All the sections of the website are mentioned below for clarity:

1. Navbar

   Please note that the navbar should be sticky, that is, it should always be visible even when the content is scrolled up. You can take a look at [this prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/DIdUsbfZCRYOTuLbhezaiC/Portfolio---Set-1?node-id=1152-6650&t=JETDSsheV8K9fUxi-0&scaling=scale-down-width&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1) for better understanding.

2. Hero Section
2. Footer
2. Contact Information
2. “Projects” Section
2. “Recommendations” Section

   Please note, that you can use any JS library for implementing a working carousel.

7. “Leave Me Your Info” Section

   When the user submits the form, it should print the data on console and show a confirmation dialog. Please make sure to handle the form validation.

Skills Page

As mentioned in the home page section, the “Navbar” & “Footer” are static and the “Navbar” should stick at the top when the content is scrolled up. Apart from that, the following are the things that you need to do on this page:

1. **“Skills” Section**
- The title and subtitle are static.
- Populate the cards using mock data.
2. **“Add Skill” Feature**
- Clicking “Add Skill” opens a dialog with a form.
- Form submission adds a new skill.
- Validations:
- Domain is a required field.
- At least one skill must be associated with the domain.
- Proficiency level must be specified for each skill.

Good to have

1\. Mobile Responsive

There is no responsive design given. In case you want to make your page responsive, you can manage your layout in such a way that it doesn’t break on different viewport sizes.

1. Implement a working carousel for the “Recommendations” section. **You can use a third-party library for implementing the carousel.**
1. You can use the “Inter” font family (Google Font).
1. You can use any code editor of your choice.
1. The assets/images/icons should be used as provided in the mockups.

Frequently asked questions

1. **Should we use CSS properties and dimensions exactly as mentioned in the mockup?**

   **Do we have to create the ditto of the template shared on Figma or some layout variations are acceptable?**

   The UI should be as close as possible to the mock-up as mentioned in the assignment. That can be achieved using the PerfectPixel Chrome extension, a link to which has been provided in the assignment document. Minute variation is acceptable. We **do not** recommend using the CSS/units from Figma. We expect the usage of CSS best practices, which might not be well exhibited by the styles in Figma.

2. **Is it mandatory to create HTML pages pixel-perfect?**

   Yes. We expect the implementation to be as close as possible to the mock-ups. However, we recommend following the priority order mentioned in the assignment document.

   We recommend the usage of the extension to achieve pixel perfection. However, you can use some other tools as well to achieve pixel perfection.

3. **Do we have to use images in our HTML file with exactly the same size?**

   The images can be in a size similar to the size it is visible in the designs. Even if the dimensions of any image are greater than required, the size taken up by that image on the web page must be similar to what we have in the designs.

4. **Which technologies can be used to implement the webpage?**

   You should use plain JS for the application. Additionally, you may choose any UI library or framework that suits your needs. For implementing the carousel, you are free to use any library of your preference.

5. **Should the carousel be working? If yes, how many slides must be slid in one go?**

   Yes, the slider must be working. You can use any third-party Javascript/Jquery plugin for implementing the same. One slide must be slid in one go/click.

6. **What interactions should be there on the slider?**

   The basic interactions like navigating using the back and next buttons are mandatory. Further, drag and keyboard arrow button interaction is good to have.

7. **Should we have the width of the web page shown in designs(like width 1440px) or should it be according to different viewports(like width 100%)?**

   The webpage can be fluid in layout and can consume 100% width as needed. It should work well on the viewport range of the desktop sizes without having to scroll horizontally. At 1440px, the UI is expected to be close to pixel-perfect with the designs.

8. **Is it important to make the webpage mobile responsive?**

   If you’re implementing mobile responsiveness, that’s a plus. But we recommend following the priority order by

1. Creating the web page first
1. Implementing the working slider
1. Making it pixel-perfect
9. **How do you submit the assignment?**
